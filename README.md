##VinBigData Competition: abnormalities Detection using Deep Learning
This repository contains the code and resources for the VinBigData competition on abnormalities detection using deep learning techniques. The project aims to develop an accurate pneumonia detection system leveraging the VinBigData dataset.

#Dataset
The VinBigData dataset consists of a large collection of chest X-ray images. The dataset has been resized to a resolution of 512x512 pixels to standardize the input for the model. It contains multiple classes representing different types of chest abnormalities, enabling multiclass classification.

#Model Architecture and Training
The YOLOv5 model was chosen for its efficient object detection capabilities. The model was trained using the VinBigData dataset with a batch size of 20 and trained for 30 epochs. Preprocessing techniques such as resizing and normalization were applied to the images before feeding them into the model.

The trained model achieved impressive results in abnormalities detection, showcasing its accuracy and performance. The convolution_matrix.png file displays the confusion matrix, providing insights into the model's performance across different classes. The result.png image showcases sample predictions made by the model, comparing them with ground truth labels.

#Results and Visualizations
The project achieved impressive results in pneumonia detection, demonstrating the effectiveness of deep learning for medical image analysis. The repository includes visualizations such as the confusion matrix (convolution_matrix.png) and sample predictions (result.png) for further analysis.

#Conclusion
This project highlights the importance of accurate pneumonia detection using deep learning techniques. By leveraging the VinBigData dataset and the YOLOv5 model, the system demonstrates promising results in automating the detection of pneumonia from chest X-ray images. It contributes to the field of medical image analysis and holds potential for improving healthcare outcomes.
